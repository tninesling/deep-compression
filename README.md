# Deep Compression

UIUC CS521, Research Project Exploring Deep Compression for DNNs

# Overview

Deep Compression is a pipeline for reducing the size of deep neural nets using a combination of pruning, quantization, and encoding, originally described by [Han, Mao, and Dally](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.00149.pdf).

# Goals
